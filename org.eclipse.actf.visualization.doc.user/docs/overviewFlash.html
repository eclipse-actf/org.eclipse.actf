<H1>Overview of the Flash Accessibility perspective</H1>
<p>
Recently rich Web content that is visually attractive and interactively controllable by the user input 
can be created with technologies such as Ajax (DHTML) or Adobe&reg; Flash (Flash).
At the same time this situation makes such content quite inaccessible for visually impaired people.
However even if the developers of the content want to make it accessible, there is no support system.
</p>
<p>
The Flash Accessibility perspective supports accessibility checking of webpages containing Flash content.
This function uses the output of the Microsoft&reg; Active Accessibility (MSAA), which is an assistive technology for the 
Microsoft Windows&reg;, and simulates how the webpage will be read by screen readers without actually using a screen reader. 
The ACTF also retrieves the runtime structure of the Flash content, 
which helps a Flash developer in modifying the content based on the results of the check.
